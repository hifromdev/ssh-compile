# SSH-Compile

This is a succint python script that uses SSH to connect to a virtual machine, compile some C++ code, and place the compiled binary back onto the host system. I created this script to allow myself to compile C++ code on newer versions of MacOS due to, what I deem, unsolvable headaches with package conflicts during compile-time.
